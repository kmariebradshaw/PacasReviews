Emilie,Baltimore,2,2018-10-31 16:50:36 UTC,2," Overall I will be honest and say that there are both good and bad things about this product. 
Good:
1.  The directions were very easy to follow 
2.   They were comfortable once I finally did get them into the shoe
3.   They were no-show, which I appreciate 
Bad:
1.   I was advised that we could return items that didn’t fit. When I contacted customer service multiple times they kept hedging, and then when I posted a question on social media it was deleted. I’m guessing that they don’t return even though they say they do. 
2.  When I finally ordered a different size, figuring I would never receive return, it took almost 2 weeks to even be shipped, despite paying for two day shipping. 
3.  If you leave these in your shoes to long, they kind of bonded to the leather, and then when you try to take them out it tries to take the interior of your shoe out with it. 

Good premise, bad execution and worse customer service.  Apparently the customer service is no show as well as the product. ",esyke623@hotmail.com,

First off, these took FAR longer than the expected arrival date to even ship, and I was only updated on their status after I reached out to the company. I wore my pair in ballet flats for ONE DAY of work, and they totally smell, gave me blisters (because the top of the sock that fits into the heel of the shoe is not soft), and barely stayed stuck to the shoe. I honestly am really annoyed that I bought a pair for myself and my BF because neither of us like them (he couldn't even get his to stay in his vans long enough to walk around the house).

Kim,Hennessy,2,2018-10-25 14:03:44 UTC,1,They are horrible.  they made my feet sweat terribly.  they were uncomfortable and gave me blisters on the back of both heels.  And they were a total rip off - one pair for $24.  They're going in the trash.  ,kahennessy@gmail.com,

This was an all-around horrible experience which is pretty upsetting for a new company with an innovative product to ""take a chance on"" and doesn't deliver to expectations.
First, the company took two weeks to process the order another week to ship after the shipping label was created and a week to ship to my house, 4 WEEKS to deliver 1 pair of socks. Honestly a laughable turnaround in this day and age. Then once I received the item I tried it on and it didn’t fit. With all the tags and labels attached I returned the item following their return policy guidelines and they proceed to deny my return. Not to mention spending nearly $25 on a pair of socks and now don’t fit. What a waste of money and time. I see numerous other negative reviews rolling in so please do your own “review research” before spending a dime on this company. 
I was excited to try this product for a Global Gaming event for the tech industry that could have really sold a long-term customer with the potential to reach a huge network of clients/customers, especially reaching women within the industry who would really benefit from a product like this.

I've had to buy new pairs of flats like every couple months because the stink just ruins them. Well this time, that's not happening. I've been using gekks for less than a month and they seem to be holding up great to my stinky feet. The other problem I tend to have when buying new flats is blisters and since using gekks, I have not had one blister. The only issue I've had is when I slide my feet into the flat the top part has to be adjusted so the front of my foot will go right into the flap. Regardless of that, this product still deserves 5 stars because it solved my main problem. I will be purchasing 2 more pairs! ",deanna.kowaleski@gmail.com,

Jody,Carrigan,2,2018-09-22 14:17:14 UTC,3,"I wasn't ""wowed"" by my purchase (flats and heel socks).  First, adhesive #2:  the left and right top edges have no adhesive.  As such, you need to ensure your heel doesn't move the material when inserting your foot.  If the edges slightly fold, the material rubs on the back of your heel.  Secondly, the paper on adhesive #3 (on all 4 socks) did not come off in one piece.  Adhesive #3 on one of my flat socks ""looked"" like it had been peeled off and reapplied.

Emily,Russell,2,2016-09-27 12:30:06 UTC,4,"In Florida, it is possible to go barefoot all year long. But most employers do not approve of bare feet in the workplace...even after a pedi! So most days, I wear ballet flats over my bare feet. I saw an ad for Gekks and thought that I would try it out.  I've have them in my shoes for about a week now, and I must saw that they exceeded my expectations. My Gekks are comfortable and help with the issues of odor control, better than I expected. Only a couple of small issues-- 1. Placement of the grippers can be difficult originally. Placing them in just the right spot can be a challenge the first time, but the Gekk sock makes up for any slight errors. And 2. I was cursed with long feet and toes... I wear a size 10. The first few time I wore my ballet flat with my Gekks it was a little awkward getting ALL my toes into the little pocket on the end (my little piggy on the end still misses out sometimes...), but after a week, my Gekks are starting to mold to my foot a little better.

But I'm no fan of high heels either. I'd tried a bunch of different tiny socks to solve the flat problem, but Gekks aren't even just better than the tiny socks -- it's like they totally eliminate all my problems with flats. An account of my day: 1) Gekks are always right in my shoes, eliminating the need to hunt around for matching tiny socks (which are impossible to find despite the fact that I own probably 12 pairs of them); 2) Gekks are both more comfortable than not wearing socks with flats AND than wearing socks with flats: they don't slide around or scrunch down during the day, but there is still the moisture-absorption and toe protection from the inside of the shoe; 3) my feet do not smell EVER. Not while I'm wearing them, not right after I take them off, not when I stuff my shoes in my gym bag and leave them for 3 days. 4) these cost me pretty much what a week's worth of tiny socks cost, and yet I only need 1 pair; 5) Less laundry = more time to enjoy life.

What I would love to see if possible as an improvement is the breathability of the material (my feet sweat in these but not in my cotton no show socks) and the ability of the edges in the bottom round part of the back corners to stay down as opposed to curl inward.

Jacque,Kreitzer,2,2018-07-11 23:54:33 UTC,4,"Overall I think they are nice. I like the fact that they stick and stay in the shoe (even though a part of mine became unstuck after the second wear, and the wash trick didn’t work so I had to peel back a layer to make it stick again). I don’t like that the toe part is not structured at all. I understand it needing to stretch some since it is for different sizes but in the pictures it looks like it stands up by itself and you slide in your toes (but in fact it is more like a flimsy pocket and you have to kind of lift up and put your toes in each time or it doesn’t want to go on your toes correctly). Lastly I like that they don’t smell but the special fibers they use leave a metal colored grayish residue on my toes mainly my big toe and second toe.   Like I said overall they are nice I haven’t had them long enough to see how long the fabric last, but they seem well made.  I would say they are worth trying and seeing how you like them for sure.",kreitzj@live.com,

I have received no explanation as to why I have not yet received my purchase nor have I been offered any kind of good faith discount for the inconvenience.

I don't like how you have to place a permanent adhesive to your shoe which cannot be removed-although I realize you can still wear the shoe normally with the gripper in place. The toe piece rolls and rubs causing pain and irritation to the top of my toes.

I sent an email to gosockless@mygekks.com on 11/7 informing you that I have not received my order, and respectfully requested that a replacement package or refund be provided. I did not receive a response. I sent a second email with the same request on 11/11 and still have not received a response. 

I also contacted UPS, as the shipper, and they responded that I would need to coordinate with you directly because you chose to have USPS deliver on their behalf.

Meredith,Treadwell,2,2016-11-26 00:29:14 UTC,2,"So I really, really, really wanted to love this product. I loved the idea of it, and I had the perfect pair of shoes to use them with. However, first I was put off by how long it took for me to get the product after I ordered it - almost an entire month. But, I was willing to get past that because I figured that just as many people saw an add for these like I did and so you were back ordered. So when I finally got them in and put them in my shoes (after having to watch the video online - the instructions on the actual product aren't so great, but the video was quite helpful) I was really excited and thought I would love them. Unfortunately, I didn't. I could only wear them for 1 entire day before i gave up on them entirely. First, they made my feet SO sweaty - even more than they were before. I would take my foot out of the shoe and it was almost like I could see the wet outline of my foot just sitting there in my shoe. It was kind of gross. Then, I could never get the toe of the Gekk to sit comfortably around my toes. It kept wanting to roll under my toes or off the side of my toe. It was frustrating to say the least. I'm giving it a 2 star review because I like the idea of the Gekks - I really do. I think you could probably improve them and they be a super stellar product. But even if you did make improvements to the product, I don't think I'd ever purchase it again. Sorry. It cost me too much money to wait as long as I did for them and for them not to work.

I purchased a pair for my Born ballet flats.  I wear these daily to work.  After 2 weeks of wearing them, the back piece adhesive is completely gone making them totally worthless.

I emailed to let the company know how dissatisfied I was with my purchase and didn't ever hear back. These ballet flat inserts don't work as advertised, they are incredibly uncomfortable. The part that your toes go in pull and end up slipping off your toes and wedging between them as the day goes on. The liner is rolling and sticky, and they stink! The whole purpose is to not need to wear socks! I can't believe I just spent $20 on these and paid shipping and handling for this garbage. Oh and it took forever to deliver.  I tried peeling them out of my shoes and it's ruined the inside of the shoes I bought too! So in total I've wasted over $100!! I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. Especially as I've tried to contact the company to let them know the product flaws and no one has gotten back to me. ",heatherbetts1844@gmail.com,

Unfortunately, the new work shoes I put them in were unbearable to wear, so after one day of wearing them, I chose to remove the gripper set to return them -- you could barely tell the gripper sets had been in the shoes, which was great!  When I went to buy a new gripper set (for the replacement shoes), I regretted not purchasing an extra gripper set with my original order, as the cost of shipping was going to be another $4.90 (for a $2.50 gripper set).  Thankfully, Gekks had wonderful customer service and waived the shipping fee at my request, given the circumstances!

I've been wearing my Gekks ballet flats in two pairs of shoes for a couple weeks now (both flats with pointy toes) and they are comfortable and -- BONUS -- keep my feet warmer than just wearing flats alone. I only rotate between two pairs of ballet flats at a time (usually ones I can't wear socks with) so they get worn out quickly and (full disclosure) stinky quickly.

Allison,Burns,2,2017-03-14 22:07:49 UTC,4,"I've never worn flats without hosiery before because I find it too uncomfortable to wear flats barefoot. Also, I haven't been able to find a pair for flat socks that wasn't either too tight, would slide around, or could see the sock peeking out around the flats. Gekks are comfortable, stay in place, and were odorless. My reasons for rating them 4 stars instead of 5 were: I didn't realize I couldn't switch the 1 pair around different pairs of flats. Once that adhesive base layer is applied to the inside of the shoe, you can't take it out and put it in different shoe. Also, I wish there was some way to make the left and right sides of the foot more comfortable (compared to the toe and heel)",allisonpullen1@gmail.com,
Sara,Nesbit,2,2017-03-14 23:48:59 UTC,3,They're nice because I don't have to wear socks but they fall off my toes a lot. Also I don't know if it's just because I put them in a shoe pair that already was used or what but they don't really  do much to stop the foot odor. ,chickadee1788@msn.com,

I ended up tearing them out and putting them in the trash while walking down a sidewalk because the wrinkled portion was giving me a blister.

So, I bought 6 pair of dress flats for work and 2 pair of sneakers for casual. However, all of the rubbed my heels raw.  I tried wearing huge band aids on my heels but they slipped out of place and of course didn't help. One day while cruising the web I saw an advertisements for GEKKS and said what could this be. After reading the website I placed my order and couldn't wait for them to come. I ordered 4 pair with two extra heel pads and I have put them in four pair of my shoes.  I cannot believe the difference! I can wear the shoes with no slipping, rubbing or blisters and my neuropathy even seem to be better!

Mary-Charles,Rasbach,2,2017-05-14 18:25:08 UTC,1,"I bought a pair of the women's ballet flat Gekks to go into a brand new pair of Tieks.  I was less than impressed with the Gekks.  Within 3 wears, it was evident that ""the sockless stench"" was not at all eliminated by them.  In fact, it was much worse with the Gekks than if I had just gone sockless. When I tried remove the socks, they tore like tissue paper.  Worse, the gripper set was almost impossible to remove, and the rubbing alcohol recommended to remove the adhesive gel ruined my brand new shoes.  Did you know leather dye is soluble in alcohol?  Neither did I until this 'experiment.'  Now my new navy Tieks are weirdly stained and still have bits of glue in them.  A $175 pair of shoes absolutely ruined after 3 wears.  Thanks for nothing, Gekks.  I would have been much better off with the 8-pack of cotton flats liners I can buy at Costco for $10.",mary.rasbach@gmail.com,

Michelle,Salemka,2,2017-05-29 21:02:24 UTC,1,"Overall, these fell way below my expectations.  They were a pain to install, don't perform as expected and the customer service is a joke. I strongly dislike that I can only use them for a single pair of shoes (if I'm paying over $20 for what is essentially a pair of socks, I want them to be universal) and the whole ""slip on"" thing is a ruse. Unless you flip the toe inside out, you can't put them on without getting bunched up. At least 1/4 of the time I wear them, at least one of the toe portions gets bunched up or slips off one of my toes.  They smell after a week of wear. I'm afraid to put them in the wash because a thread is already pulling out from the back of one. They are discolored already  (again, after only a week of wear) and the logo has worn off, so my very nice flats look trashier because of them. The adhesive is already coming unstuck from the inside of one of my shoes after taking the liners out maybe 3 times. 

All this after they took over 3 weeks to get to me with 2+ day wait times every time I sent a customer service inquiry. I live about 5 miles from where they're made, by the way. 

Overall, I can't recommend against them firmly enough and frankly just hope that this review discourages someone else from making the same mistake I did in buying them.

Annie,Burrows,2,2017-06-01 15:08:29 UTC,5,"Gekks have solved the ballet flat sock problem that has plagued me for years. The options for no-show socks made for ballet flats are pretty disappointing. They always peak out of the shoes, they slip off the heal, or shift in the shoe. They are also almost impossible to keep track of in my drawers. So far the Gekks I placed in one of my frequently worn ballet flats have solved all of these issues. They do not show at all. Of course they don't slip because they are attached to the shoe. They prevent rubbing in my heel and in the toe box. And almost the best part of all, I don't have to dig trough my sock drawer to find the perfect ""no-show"" sock for these shoes! I have yet to see if they really hold up to the no-stink claims. I have worn my flats with the Gekks about 3 times and no significant stink yet. But they are machine washable so I'm not too worried about it. ",annie.burrows@gmail.com,

They really do control sweat and odor, I have been using them for about a year now in two pairs of flats and haven't needed to wash them yet.  Placing them was easy, and they're comfortable.

Kristi,Nelson,2,2017-06-07 04:52:44 UTC,2,"I like the concept, but they are far from perfect and I may not use them in the long-term. Here are my issues: 1) I ordered the medium size which is for shoe sizes 6.5-7.5. I'm a size 7 and the sock part seems too big. The instructions said to install it with the front edge of the sock at the shoe entrance, but the sock was too long to do that. I didn't stretch it at all during installation, and even tried to ""compress"" it lengthwise so it would install per the instructions, but then it felt weird. 2) because the length is all wonky, my pinky toes end up outside of the sock causing it to rub uncomfortably.  3) The fabric edge is not very soft (especially noticable at the instep and heel) so I'm concerned that walking longer distances will cause blisters (my feet are very sensitive to stitching in my shoes, especially on the footbed). 4) They do not appear to be specific to left/right, so the installation of the grippers and sock liners was weird and not ideal. My ballet flats have arch supports, so I wish I had spent more time customizing the grippers.",klknelson@hotmail.com,

Once in, extremely comfortable all day.

,Kelly,2,2017-06-11 15:19:31 UTC,2,"I bought these for my favorite pair of shoes- my black matte Tieks- in order to alleviate some odor issues I had been having after 8 months of owning them. The first day I wore the Gekks, it was a huge improvement, but by day 3, the sticker inserts had shifted, bunched up, etc, so I kept trying to move them back into place. As a result, my feet were shifting uncomfortably also, and were picking up sticky residue from the shifted insole. I carefully removed my new Gekks and inserts from my favorite pair of shoes, only to find an unremoved sticky mess. I'm desperately trying to un-stickify them, so I can wear my shoes again even if my feet might get a little stinky! My shoes were a big investment, and I will continue to try to clean them properly, but I currently miss just throwing these on before a long workday in the city. As for the Gekks themselves, they were comfortable and did prevent odor while they were in the right place within the shoe. The sock did stay attached to the sticker lining, quite impressively.

I had to wait to get home to check what the heck was going on because it just felt completely sticky on the sides. Because these are not made for wide feet my poor pinky toes kept sliping out of the toe area and I could feel it slowly slipping from my big toe. I contacted Gekks and they did offer me a 2 free pair, but honestly I am no longer interested after using them. Plus the toe sock area doesn't 'grip' around the toes properly and it rolls over the toes creating a thicker area (like the seams of a normal sock) and it rubs very uncomfortably against the toes. Or it siply slips out under the toes when walking. I bought it because I don't wear heels at all. Only flats and it's difficult to find socks that don't slip on the back when walking. Well, these did not slip on the back, but it gave me more issues than I wanted. I'd rather deal with the regular one slipping on the back over this at this price too. Sorry Gekks. Not for me.

The fabric of the grippers detached from the plastic of the gripper because the glue that held it together melted. They moved all around in my shoe, giving me blisters and leaving a sticky mess in my very expensive flats. I was away from home when this happened, so was left with few options for my shoes since this was all I had brought with me. I finally had to remove the grippers altogether, which ripped part of the leather of my soles, and still left a sticky residue in my shoe.

With the loose sock-like toe, it takes some effort to adjust, smoothe, etc. to get them in place.  And for me, the toes were VERY uncomfortable.  It drives me crazy to have elastic barely covering my toes.  Would be so much better if they were a little deeper.  I had to rip them out after a day of trying to wear.  Same problems with the sneaker liner too.  The loose toe is a pain.  I'd rather put on a pair of socks.  Big waste of time and money.",libbiev@gmail.com,

My problem has been with the portion that attaches to the inside of the shoes. After a few weeks of wear, I noticed that the portion that the inserts stick too were slipping around. There seems to be a clear plastic looking backing that sticks to the shoes, then there is a tan portion that is the velcro like surface that holds the socks in place. In my shoes, the clear plastic portion is staying in place where I attached it. However, the tan portion has separated from the clear portion and is moving around. It seems like soon it will detach entirely and will no longer hold the socks in place. I've tried to move the tan portion back in place.

Because I have bigger (9-9.5 US wms) feet, it's difficult to find ""no show"" style socks to wear in my flats and barefoot isn't an option because they get smelly really quickly. I was hoping this would resolve all of those issues, but I am really disappointed. After spending more than $20CAD on one pair (after shipping), I was really hoping for more. Instead, it just feels like you're wearing socks that are sloppy in the toe (despite my wider-than-average feet) and they feel like they are constantly falling down in the heel as well. Maybe they would work for those with smaller feet, but there's no way I could bear the thought of wearing them for a full day.

Installation was also pretty difficult, even after watching the video. You have to lay the sticky part perfectly flat otherwise it will bunch up and expose the adhesive, which will stick to the sock. And if you remove the product entirely, it will leave a sticky residue behind.

CYNDI,MCFEETERS,2,2017-09-18 23:28:42 UTC,1,The whole flat shoe system didn't work for me. The socks didn't stick to the gripper. The socks smelled awful by the end of the first day. And the second set of grippers I used were bunching up by the end of the week and the heel gripper came completely off. I wanted so bad for this to work and it was awful.

,Jennifer,2,2017-09-19 19:38:44 UTC,3,"I have a mixed review of the Ballet Flats. Once they're in the shoe, they feel great and fit beautifully.  However, the ""stickiness"" or lack thereof when in the shoe, has been an issue.  When I opened the package, the paper that covered the sticky portion of the flats fell off and the sticky parts kept sticking together. Plus one of the heels started to unravel because it got stuck on one of the sticky areas. When I put the Ballet Flat heel part in the back of my shoe, it kept unsticking. I had to hold two places down with my hand to just put my foot into the shoe. It was kind of frustrating. 
I hate to write this because the fit and feel is great once the Flat is in and positioned. But, it was a bit of a chore to make it work. ",jferquilts@att.net,

Two weeks later (I'm a patient person) I hadn't received anything - no product or even a shipment notification, so I reached out again and received the exact same message except with a later ship date!!

Jessica,Farmer,2,2017-09-22 14:58:30 UTC,2,"At first, I loved how gekks worked. They met my expecting s. No smelly feet/shoes and you couldn't see them when they were being worn. However, after only 7 days of wear, the sticky layer actually began shifting and peeling up from the insole of my flats. This made the sock part of my gekks shift as we'll. And get all crumpled in my shoe, exposing my bare feet to the sticky later. So I ended up having sticky smelly feet and feeling uncomfortable when I wore this pair of flats. I tried once to readjust the sticky layer, but it just got worst. I was really diasappointed in my gekks. I wanted them to work so bad! ",jessicahummel06@yahoo.com,

The installation was clumsy but had finally gotten them in one pair.  Wore the shoes all day and they did not slip but not sure how long this adhesive will keep the heels up.  For the price of one pair of these socks I am not sure they are practical enough to use for future shoes.

Betty,Vondran,2,2017-09-22 20:15:10 UTC,4,"more difficult to install than expected; the instruction sheet enclosed showed an anchor piece for toes as well as heel and sole, and nothing was included (although on the online video one is not shown either).  Not having the toe piece anchored makes it a bit wonky to get them on straight so something isn't rubbing a toe or bunching under the foot...perhaps its a learning curve?  Will wear them a few more times to try to get used to them and see if they do hold up as well as promised.

They definitely help my everyday work flats. I'm only rating these 4 stars though because the customer service and order process is awful.

Elizabeth,Thames,2,2017-09-28 19:05:04 UTC,4,"The adhesive portion of the Gekks fit perfectly into my flats and adhered well to the shoe. The liner is simple to attach and doesn't affect the way the shoe feels when you wear it with non-Gekk socks.

But then it came time to attach the Gekk sock to the liner, and I wondered if it was the wrong size. I had to stretch the socks to their limit to get them to fit the shoe. When I wore them, the toe cover on the sock hits my toes at a funny place because of how small or low they are. This might be a design choice to allow people to wear extremely low cut flats, but it made them much less comfortable than they could have been. Also, whereas the liner was perfectly smooth and comfortable to walk on, the sock had a strange ribbed texture that felt rough on my feet. 

Nevertheless, the Gekks did accomplish what they promised: I was able to wear flats all day without socks. I loved being able to slip my feet in and out of the shoe without ugly no-show socks showing, and the overall concept was excellent. It definitely makes my ballet flats more appealing to wear. But I think the sock design could use some work.",elizabeth.c.thames@gmail.com,

They do do a pretty good job IF you have a shoe that doesn't need any sort of insert or heel snugs, but they do tend to be a bit slippery- be careful as you might slide out of your shoe. The material isn't nearly as soft as I was expecting for something that is supposed to replace socks. I guess my hunt goes on. ",startirs@aol.com,

I inserted them into a pair of shoes but haven't tried them yet. However, I am bummed by the fact that I have to insert adhesive ""grippers"" into each pair of shoes I want to use with the gekks. This automatically limits the number of shoes I can pair with the socks as I would have to have these grippers for every pair of shoes. So ... too pricey for me.  

Also, I wanted more coverage over my toe area and up the sides of my feet - this pad just covers my toes and is only below my sole. It may be that I bought the wrong configuration so this might work for someone else just fine. ",elledough@gmail.com,

I'm putting these in as many shoes as possible! They make wearing shoes without socks so much more comfortable. Installation is a little difficult the first time, but the videos make it easy to figure out. Also, the first time you wear them, you will probably have to adjust a little, but after that, they will be set and comfortable.

One feature that I wish the ballet flats had in particular is a wider coverage of the heel portion of the shoe. These help prevent blisters at the very back of my heel, but my usual problem areas are further to the sides, where the gekks don't cover.

I also work outside, so that means sweaty flats all summer! I admit I haven't really tested the stink factor very much just yet, but I'm sold on how much more comfortable my brand new flats instantly became when I put these liners in. So much so that I didn't realize I'd actually bought my shoes too small until I put the Gekks in. They relieved all the pressure points causing blisters so the only pain I was feeling was my toe hurting from too small shoes.

I've tried inserts, baby powder, you name it, but I eventually gave up and stopped wearing them. The Gekks I ordered do the job PERFECTLY. They're comfy, easy to install and completely eliminate foot odor. My only complaint is that they feel a little slippery to walk in. The toe doesn't have adhesive, so if I curl my toes the wrong way, the sock gets all bunched up and I have to take the shoe off and re-adjust. And sometimes when I walk I'm afraid my foot is going to slip out of my shoe.

The material and quality of the sock, however, is surprisingly flimsy and cheap. I expected more for my money than a paper thin piece of fabric with 2 sewed-on pieces at the ends.

Leanne,Acker,2,2018-04-17 18:53:13 UTC,3,"They met my expectations. They fit well into my flats and stick very nicely and don't slip around or show at all. I'm not sure I'm buying into the idea that they don't need to be washed. I feel kinda icky wearing them more than a few times without washing. Of course washing them destroys a layer of the sticky stuff, which means they wear out faster. I also think the website needs to explain how they work a bit better and what you get when you buy a pair. ",acker.leanne@gmail.com,
Catherine,Boswell,2,2018-04-17 20:53:25 UTC,5,"I have to admit - when I opened the box and saw the socks, I thought they looked super stupid and pretty useless.  The box sat on my counter for over a week waiting to be returned.  Then, I decided to just try one pair since I knew it was going to gradually heat up during the day.  

Holy. Moly.  These socks are game changers for sweated feeted folks like myself. They don't slip at all which was my main fear.  Better yet, at the end of the day, when I took my ballet flats off, I didn't immediately have to rinse off my feet for fear of stinking up my house. THANK YOU, GEKKS.",catlboswell@gmail.com,

I did not consider that 1) what am I supposed to do with my arch inserts when using Gekks? (A: you can't really use both) 2) they might not stick in broken-in shoes because there's already some dirt and sweat in your shoes.

After the sticky pads got linty, I tried washing them as suggested, and now they don't stick at all. So, I got a good week out of one pair - having to put them on my foot and wiggle into the shoe every time pretty much after the first day.

The material that covers the toes is so small, that if you have short toes, like I do, the pinky toe keeps slipping out. I wear a 9.5 shoe and bought the large size for sizes 9-11 and they are pretty short on me, I don't know how a size 11 is supposed to wear them. Also, if you open them to see if they would work for you, then you're not able to return them if they do not work out. Not a great policy. ",cmlwager@gmail.com,

However the adhesive under the foot and on top of the shoe failed after one week. I have cleaned them as per instructions which didn't make a huge difference.

Riya,Ramani,1,2018-07-24 14:55:47 UTC,2,"Pretty disappointed - the adhesive doesn’t work well. I had to peel back to the second layer and even then it was still not sticking properly to my shoe (these were the gekks for the loafers). Feels weird when wearing them too and definitely wouldn’t recommend wearing them in summer. After only 2 wears they were already smelling pretty bad. Overall I think this was a waste of my money, too bad I can’t get a refund.",riyaramani@gmail.com,
Tammy,Douglass,1,2018-07-25 13:34:24 UTC,3,"Honestly, i'm torn. i LOVE the idea of them. My shoes don't get 'stinky' from wearing them barefoot, but after literally wearing them in one pair of shoes for maybe 5 times, the cloth is disconnecting from the sticky part that goes in the shoe. If they are already doing that, how could i wash them (it says they can be washed if needed). They would completely fall apart. They are rather expensive and i'm not so impressed honestly with the quality. Again, like i said, i love the idea behind them, but they didn't meet the expectations i had for wearing them.

The exact prices escape my memory now, but I bought enough to get the 15% off, which I think was somewhere in the ball park of $60... for a few pairs of socks. Once the 15% was applied, it apparently put me under the threshold for free shipping.  So I was tempted to go back and add more, but then I realize I'm about to be $80 deep into socks that I don't even know if I'll like yet. So I begrudgingly continue as is and pay their shipping.

Katelynn,Barr,1,2016-12-19 14:42:19 UTC,1,"I haven't put in my loafers and tennis shoe gekks yet, but I am SO disappointed with my flats Gekks. First, putting them in wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. I was extremely careful so the sticker wouldn't fold up on itself while putting the heel piece in, but it was very challenging. When I got the grippers in, I made sure to push them down and smooth them out, insuring that they would stick. I then put the Gekks in and tried them on with my Tieks. I wanted to see if the gekks could be work without the grippers in another pair of flats so I began pulling the Gekks out. When I did this, the grippers also came out with the gekks. I was able to restick them back in, but it's so disappointing to me that it's advertised that the grippers can be worn without the gekks but there should be a warning that every time you need to get the gekks out, you need to be extremely careful. is this going to happen every time I want to wash them or wear them with another pair of shoes? I had such high hopes for these and I hope the other two pairs aren't as disappointing. ",barrk0520@gmail.com,

If you want to order the stick on part only so you can wear them with different shoes, the price is still $16.  So for the price, I would not order more.  Also, the company billed my credit card for the full amount on the day that I ordered but they did not ship  for over a week.

Kathleen,Ferrell,1,2017-05-31 00:07:02 UTC,1,"The low rating is mainly for the poor customer service I received during the placement of this order. I ordered a single pair of gekks to wear in a pair of dress shoes and liked them, so when I received a coupon I thought I'd go ahead and order another pair. The cost of this particular pack was enough to give me free shipping so I chose it over just buying a pair or two. Entered my coupon code, paid, and thought ""huh the total's a little high."" I look at the order confirmation: they took away the free shipping when I entered the coupon code. I thought, no problems, I'll just write customer service and they'll correct it. They never bothered responding.

10 days pass, I still haven't even received a shipping notification. I write customer service (again), express my concern at the lack of shipping notification and comment again on the shipping charge. I get a response this time, the rep states they're changing the product and that caused the delay. No apology. No response about the extra amount I was charged.

I wasn't told this was a pre-order, which is definitely what it is when you sell something you don't have stock of. I also wasn't told of product changes and I would have waited to see reviews of the new product before buying if I had known it would be different.  Finally a full month after taking my order it finally ships, again with no acknowledgement of the delay or removal of shipping charges.

So, the super upgrades I had to wait so long for in order to receive my supergekks? The logo is printed on the gripper now. Oh and the sock seems slightly less well made. Woohoo. Not a big enough gripe to send them back, they do their job just as well, but really it's hard to remove all the negative customer service from the experience.",scwkitty@gmail.com,

The problems came when I went to wash them for the first time. Even though I was careful in removing them, the material that they adhere to (which is supposed to stay inside your shoe) came off. I was able to stick them back inside the shoe, but they don't lay evenly anymore (they bunched up) and now I'm nervous about what happens the second time I attempt to wash them... will they lose their stick and go back in at all? The other problem was that the socks are so sticky that they ruined a couple items of clothing that were in the wash with them... including the socks themselves.

Almost great but I bought the closet pack and after using the ballet flats (the one I'd use the most as Nd anticipated buying more of this style) I  am disappointed and not interested in trying the other styles as fear of prolonged problems. Dies it cut down foot odor? Yes. But I spent 20+ minutes installing them to specs, took time at work to adjust 3 times, had a bug blister. Still hopeful, I tried again after making a couple of adjustment s AND adding blister bandaids but I hurt. It seems the back heel grip needs to be wider or taller. Soooo what do I do with the other two styles? Nothing because im nursing blister and will not try again for fear of more irritating the blister which would cause risk of infection. So sad. An expensive disappointment. If the worked, I would have bought 3 more this month alone.

It was a pricey splurge for me but I was really curious to try so I bought the closet pack. My order took nearly a month to get to me. I had to contact customer service directly to find out why the hold up after 2 weeks, and only then was I informed something about the product being upgraded to make it better? I would have appreciated a little heads up. I put my first pair into my TOMS and the first thing I realized is if you mess up on the sticky piece, that's it! No second chance. As I was putting the heel sticker on, one corner folded over and stuck to itself. After that I was screwed, and now they don't fully stick into my shoe. For the price, perhaps Gekks could include a second set of sticker thing in case of mess up? As for the liners themselves, I think I still need to figure them out because I kept getting a bunching sensation in the toe area and the seam rubbing on my pinkie toe. They did stay securely in place despite my sweaty feet, though they are made for narrow feet only and not all of my footbed is covered. I'm just sort of ""meh"" on them.",nicolelavia@gmail.com,

Kept slipping as there was lack of adhesive. Needless to say, the right foot on back of heel has raw wounds , skin rubbed off, that are extremely painful. The left foot is perfect and happy.  Left foot- 5 stars, Right foot- zero starts.  Not worth risking this happening again so going back to socks.  Very disappointed as the concept is quite good.

Crystal,Vumbaco,1,2017-06-16 16:05:16 UTC,1,"BUYERS BEWARE. 
As my star suggests, I'm quite disappointed overall. I purchased two multipacks hoping for all that they claim to be at the steep price of $79.90. I primarily wear flats and chuckies and was over the moon excited; traditional socks just don't cut it for these types of shoes. 
After the initial purchase I received my receipt a few days later. About 21 days later I emailed the company inquiring on the status of the order and if I would be getting any type of tracking or shipping confirmation. I never got a response or any other email. Another week later I emailed again, asking the same question as above and advising this was my second request as my first was ignored. I received a response a day later advising when they should have been shipped and ended up receiving them about 2 weeks after that. After patiently waiting well over a month since the purchase, I couldn't get the Gekks in my flats sooner! 
It is not the easiest installation process and took much time and patience, as many other reviews suggest. Once the Gekks were in, the comfort of the flats had changed. The toe area makes them difficult to put on properly and the way the backs require sticking to the heel part of the shoe, they now slip off my feet. Prior to putting in the Gekks the flats fit perfectly with no slippage. I also tried the sneaker version for my chuckies to no avail. I could not for the life of me get the sticky portion to adhere to the bottom properly. That part of the Gekks ended up getting ruined making the sock portion completely useless. After removing the sticky Gekks part, it left the inside of my soles a sticky mess!
When I went on the website to find return policy information, I really couldn't find anything. A live chat box popped up. I wrote that I was unsatisfied with the items I purchased, proved my order number,  and inquired on a refund. I have 4 of 6 packages unopened that I do not intend to use. I didn't get a reply from the ""live"" support until 15 minutes later, advising me to send them an email.. I advised the rep Emma that live chat is not very effective when a response is given 15 minutes after the fact. At that time Emma ended the chat session. 
On the Contact Us page the company mission states: 
""our customer service goal is simple: we are committed to responding to your inquiries in a timely fashion and providing a positive customer service experience"". 
The lack of customer service is astonishing to me if that is the company mission. I feel 7 days of no email response is unacceptable. Emailing the company a second time still left me with no tracking information or delivery date. There is no information anywhere on delivery and what expectations to have. The live chat is a joke at best and I am left so disappointed in the staff, communications, and product. They failed me at their mission. 
No I do not recommend this product or this company to anyone. And if you end up not liking the Gekks either, removing them will only ruin the entire inside bottom part of your shoes. These expensive ""socks"" can end up costing a lot more in the end.",cvumbaco1@aol.com,

I bought the closet pack to fit into various flat dress shoes (e.g. Everlane Loafers). Unfortunately by the time you stick the backing in, and then the chunky Velcro on the sock is in place the shoes are about half a size to small. I am not in the practice of buying my shoes half a size to big (and I don't plan to be), so these are completely useless. I have tried one in a single shoe, and now have two and a half packs left unused. If you want these as a replacement for thin no show socks try before you commit to the closet pack. As an additional note, I didn't have time to take the sticky base out of the single shoe that I put them in before I wore them (without the sock inserts). The shoe was less breathable and my foot got more sweaty with the backing inserts in than the one that didn't have them.

Then, due to the poor fit, don't even work.

,Michelle,1,2017-09-27 13:56:48 UTC,3,I really like the closet pack because it let me try the different types of Gekks. That being said what I didn’t like was the shipping process. I placed my order on 8/24 but didn’t receive my order until 3 wks later on 9/15. I inquired twice even asked to cancel my order and receive a refund but was only given a estimated ship date which changes twice. I didn’t receive an apology for the delay or acknowledgement in the delay only a new ship date. Because of this I probably will not reorder. Hopefully I can find them in a store one day. ,escobem@yahoo.com,

Lynne,Willock,1,2017-10-07 13:30:24 UTC,1,"I was extremely disappointed in this purchase.  First, I ordered on Aug. 31 and did not receive until Sept. 28.  I reached out twice to customer service requesting a status update.  First message said they were shipped that week (not true) and the other email went unanswered but I got an automatic email the following day saying they had shipped.

I purchased the closet pack for a trip to Europe.  I inserted the ones for my sneakers but the loafer size was too big for my shoes and were visible on top. I removed and used the ballet flats pair which seemed to fit better.

However, I wore my sneakers to the airport and had two nasty blisters on my heel before even boarding the plane.  I have worn the shoes before with socks and no issues but the gekks rubbed on my heel badly.  I am now on day 6 of my trip, still unable to wear shoes. Fortunately the weather has been nice so I've been ok in flip flops but definitely not the ideal walking shoe.

I expect someone will assume I didn't insert them correctly but it isn't rocket science! I took extra care to ensure no wrinkles but still had a terrible experience. Maybe my loafers will work better but frankly I'm nervous to try them, at least while on this trip.

I'm putting these in as many shoes as possible! They make wearing shoes without socks so much more comfortable. Installation is a little difficult the first time, but the videos make it easy to figure out. Also, the first time you wear them, you will probably have to adjust a little, but after that, they will be set and comfortable.

One feature that I wish the ballet flats had in particular is a wider coverage of the heel portion of the shoe. These help prevent blisters at the very back of my heel, but my usual problem areas are further to the sides, where the gekks don't cover.

Getting these babies in my low cut boot was insane. Getting things to lay flat and smooth so I'm not walking on wrinkles wasn't happening. I tried the process of repositioning and smoothing repeatedly.....accepted my best effort and put the sock in place.
It is so uncomfortable. The tip of the sock doesn't connect to the sole and it moves and bunches as you walk. 
Perhaps it was the type of shoe?
So not cool. 
And the wrinkly velcro that is permanently stuck to the bottom of my shoe ruined my favorite low cut black booties. ☹️  that baby isn't coming off.

It was a bummer because I needed them for flats the most. However, I'll consider buying more sneaker and loafer styles. They protect my heels and never budge no matter how active I am.

kim,kothe,1,2018-02-27 06:16:02 UTC,1,These have much more fabric making them way too long for the types of shoes they recommend. You have to basically use the ballet flat style for everything. Loafers and sneakers had the tongue portions sticking out awfully. I wasted money using the site's recommendations and now have one for loafers and one for sneakers that I can't use. I ended up spending $49 plus tax for 1 usable pair. You need to give the dimensions or specific brand of shoes these work for because your recommendations are not correct.,kimkothe@hotmail.com,

And just wearing knee high stockings made my feet stink. In my search I stumbled upon Gekks Low Cut Liners. They looked awesome but kinda pricey. I decided to give them a try anyway.

I’ll tell the good things first! They are perfect and very comfortable. Others I’ve tried either showed above the shoe at my toes or the sides or they had thin elastic and it would dig in painfully over the course of the day. These were perfect. I like that they have different types for different shoes. And best of all me feet don’t stink when wearing my flats! So totally worth the money in my opinion.

Now the bad...I placed my order on 2/28/2018. They drafted the payment right away and I figured there would be a couple days processing time but since they were listed as in stock I figured they ship out Monday at the latest. But that turn out to not be the case. I contacted them multiple times and having to wait almost a week each time for a reply.

Used them in converse low tops, ballet flats & heels. You can hardly feel they're there after a few minutes on & prevented my feet sweating hence no more smelly shoes! 😊  I can not review whether the glue will restick if removed, washed & replaced as I have not had the need yet. I don't tend to wear the same shoes day in & day out. I do have one small gripe the backs (sticks to the heel portion of shoe) were slightly too long & could be seen above the top of my shoes. I had to push them down causing a little bunching at the heel & on one pair I had to cut the end off to prevent it showing.

I either end up with wadding, or the numbers not being where they are supposed to be, to make these fit heel to toe. The loafer and sneaker cut liners, don't fit all styles.

I put them in my Sperry's (that did not previously rub my feet) and the corners of the heels on the socks are now making sore spots on my heels.

The part that is supposes to stick to the roof of the shoe doesn't stay stuck.  The Gekks for my sneakers were a disaster.  They don't fit in my Superga's at all.  I messed with them so much, the sticky wore off.  Tried to use hand sanitizer and wash them and did not make the adhesive sticky again. I had to throw them away.

sarah,epton,4,2018-07-30 01:27:19 UTC,5,"So far so good! Getting these into sneakers for the first time was a little bit of a project. Everything is clearly labelled and they've dummy proofed this as far as humanly possible with graphics and English text but putting them in for the first time was a longer process than I originally allotted and I would up with some wrinkles.  But it was easily fixed once I got the hang of it. The ones for ballet flats are easy, and I LOVE having them ready to go. 
With my work shoes the test will be time. I work on my feet 16 hours a day. My work shoes get STINKY.  And comfort is also a big factor.  For a week they've been great.  So far no odor in brand new shoes , and once I got the wrinkles smoothed out, comfy enough but a bit warmer than my normal cotton foot socks. So definitely recommend for ballet flats- not having to chase down those tiny socklet things makes them worth their weight in gold- and I recommend them with qualifications for sneakers. Ask me again when I've worked in them for 200 hours! But I think it'll be great!

I wrote the below email to your customer service department.

I am very unhappy with your product. I had a very hard time making these liners fit my shoes (see attached image of shoe type). Yes I read the directions, both the handout and on the liner itself. 

First problem, it was not clear that there were 2 components to the liners; #1 gripper - attached to liner and #2 adhesive portion with peel-away wax backing. In my first attempt, the adhesive portion completed peeled away from the gripper and I foolished tried to stick the liner into the shoe. Of course, it did not stick but rather the liner kept snagging on the gripper. After further examination I realized I needed to peel away the wax backing.

2nd problem, trying to get the bottom adhesive inside the shoe WITHOUT sticking to itself (see attached image); near impossible. After many struggles to separate the attached bottom adhesives I gave up and just tried to use the liner with the just the heel and tongue adhesive. Of course the gripper kept sticking to the liner fabric making it impossible to pull my feet out without the gripper and liner snagging.

In the end, I threw the products in the trashcan and decided to chock it up to a bad purchase and blamed myself for falling for another ""easy-to-use-gimmick.""

However, I wanted to write this email to you because I had such high hopes for this product, especially as I hate socks-that-show and despise those slippery nylon liners - I'm not mad, I am severely disappointed.

I don't know if it's my Jack Purcell's or the fabric of Gekks but my feet felt infinitely more sweaty (gross, I know) compared to wearing traditional socks.  The texture of the fabric also rubbed my feet the wrong way.  By no means did I develop blisters, but it was not comfortable.  Application was a bit cumbersome as well.  The shoe tongue area naturally creases, so the part of Gekks that was attached to that area also creased/ wrinkled.  This then pressed onto the top of my foot causing additional discomfort.  Normally this wouldn't cause any discomfort as I would have an extra barrier (socks).",orange.crayolaa@gmail.com,

However, I have noticed that my feet don't smell as pleasant as I would have hoped they would after I started using Gekks.  I guess the point of the Gekks is just to prevent your shoes from permanently smelling bad if you don't wear socks. They definitely do not prevent your feet from sweating or smelling.  I now also have to wear a band-aid on the back of my feet because the Gekks rub up against the back of my feet, resulting in sores/blisters.  I really want to like these, but if they continue to hurt me then I am going to have to remove them.  ",heathko15@gmail.com,

The sneaker version is a little harder to use than the loafers. They take longer and are a little more difficult to install. I'm using them for my lowtop Converse All Stars, and because the tongues on those shoes are so flimsy, the Gekks keep pulling them down, so I have to adjust them several times a day.

I sent two subsequent emails thanking them for the offer but explaining that what I needed was actually new socks not the sticking attachments.

It still feels like you're wearing socks (which I was going it wouldn't), but they don't slide anywhere and they keep any odor away, unlike going barefoot!! I wish they had them in kids sizes! 

When you put them in your shoe, they stick to the inside sole about 3/4 of the length, the inside of the back heel and the underside of the tongue of the shoe. The toe part of the liner is loose and stretches to fit your foot when you put the shoe on. Before I put it on, I have to adjust the inside of it a little, otherwise, it feels a little twisted when I put it on. I think it just gets that way from taking the shoe off and it's an easy fix.

The shoes feel less roomy now than when I used a cheap nylon footie-liner. Getting them into the shoes was a trick, and on at least one pair, an unsuccessful game of stickiness here, there, and everywhere between the Velcro and the peel-and-stick components made these a swear-worthy event.

With all the stickers, if I put this in the washer or even hand wash will likely reduce the effectiveness of the sticky part - not sure how that will work after its been washed.  

I won't be able to recommend this just for the fact that it cannot be reused or transferred to a different shoe, the site does not mention that you should purchase for every single shoe a person may be planning on using this for.  

The concept has potential, but I would recommend that the company consider enhancing for reusability, ability to use in more than one shoe, and cleaning maintenance - no matter whose feet it is, every feet sweat so it is not hygenically good to continue reusing this without ever washing.

I tried in 3 different pair. 1 Nike and 2 ascics. I took one pair of Gekks and placed gorilla clue on the pads and that pair have stayed in for over a week now. I’ll see how long this last and ifnit does I will do the same with the other two pairs of shoes. Additionally these took forever to ship.

I got super bad blisters from this. When I pulled them out to reset them, the adhesive pads mostly came off of the socks on the bottom, so I can't really reuse them. Also, they stretched wide enough to cover the width of my toes, but the foot part of it wasnt wide enough to fill my entire shoe from left to right, so that was a bit awkward.

Rhonda,Hughes,4,2018-07-29 17:11:14 UTC,1,"I was very unimpressed with the product. Although a great idea, the execution/design is really lacking. In tight fitting shoes, the product is very difficult to install as it really bunches up and does not stay in place. The adhesive is a problem and it does not stick well, allowing movement in the shoes.

As a result, we decided to return the product. The company does not allow for returns UNLESS they are not worn/used. So, they took the product back but no refund. So, we did not wear them at all but received no credit. Full disclosure: We bought two, never tried to install the second one and did receive full credit for the unused one.

,Seth,4,2017-08-12 01:40:18 UTC,1,"This was feedback I provided to Amy on Aug 3rd, and never heard back.  

A little feedback... I am very dissappointed.  This is not a good product.  It does not do what it claims it can do.  I got home and excitedly installed the gekks.  I only wore the shoes for about 2 hours.  This is what I found:

1.  There is no gripper provided for the toe of the shoe,  so when you take the shoe off, the liner pulls inside out as you remove your foot.  When you go to put the shoe back on, the liner is bunched up and feels uncomfortable (like putting your socks on crooked).

2.  The material does not breathe.. at all! My feet were so sweaty, that I could not stand to keep wearing my shoes.  I removed them ( the liner pulled half way out because there isn't any toe gripper), and my feet smelled because they were so sweaty.   I put them back on about 30 minutes later to pick up my kid from his activity and they liner was bunched around my toes making it uncomfortable. 

I had planned on buying these for the whole family after I tested them out.  We all wear no shoe socks in the summer and I really wanted the gekks to resolve all the issues that they claimed to do.  The biggest issue for me, is the fact that the material does not breathe and makes your feet so hot and sweaty.  That is my biggest issue with no show socks because they are not made with cotton I am guessing.

I believe that you are a newer company and are trying to make your way.   I did not want to post a bad review, however I believe that you need to go back to the drawing board and make a few, necessary improvements.

I wore my pair in ballet flats for ONE DAY of work, and they totally smell, gave me blisters (because the top of the sock that fits into the heel of the shoe is not soft), and barely stayed stuck to the shoe. I honestly am really annoyed that I bought a pair for myself and my BF because neither of us like them (he couldn't even get his to stay in his vans long enough to walk around the house). This feels like a total waste of $36... and I had such high hopes from the other reviews.",htmills18@gmail.com,

stephen,devito,3,2017-06-20 02:23:12 UTC,3,"I have full grain, box calf leather loafers I tried these in.  After applying the gripper strips onto the inside of the loafers, I had an uneasy feeling about letting the adhesive bond for too long onto the leather, so I decided to remove them about 20 minutes after I applied them. When I did they pulled some of the leather off of the inside of the uppers. I can't use gekks in my expensive leather shoes because I don't want to damage them.  Maybe if there was some other less damaging way to stick the gripper strips to the inside of the shoes I'd try it again.  ",biznice@gmail.com,

The experience was so bad and the product so ineffective that it warrented a terrible review.  ",eric.pelio@gmail.com,

Ellis,van,6,2018-10-08 23:16:49 UTC,5,"I was really hesitant to purchase Gekks because a lot of the reviews were far from great ranging from bad news about the product to customer service. However, then I read a tidbit about the company moving and completely overhauling its staff to ensure better products and service, so I decided to take a chance. And I have been pleasantly surprised from the minute I clicked the ""submit my order"" button. I received an order confirmation email quickly, and an email notifying me that my order was shipped not long after that. I think I received my Gekks within 2 or 3 weeks, which considering that I live in Canada is good!

About my Gekks:
It's taken some time to properly try them out as I don't wear my shoes intended for Gekks very often due to my lifestyle and work. But.. I love them! They were easy to install, easy to slip on and off repeatedly and lovely to walk in without having to worry that they were going to slip off like my socks always did. 

I only have 2 notes to comment on, and one shouldn't really count: I find my feet super hot when I have my ""Gekks shoes"" on and wish there was a way to keep them a bit cooler... 
And, my Gekks did slip and come undone from my shoes once; when I was walking outside in a downpour and the street had flooded up to my ankles. Obviously I don't expect anything to stay put when drowning in water like that, but I just wanted to mention it should you find yourself in a similar situation. 
I did stick them back into my shoes after the flooding incident but haven't worn them since because our summer has quickly turned into winter, but my Gekks do seem to be sticky still so I'm really not worried about them.

I would highly recommend them and will definitely purchase more pairs if I buy more shoes because these are so much nicer than the stupid socks which are so useless. I only wish for them to be cooler on my feet to make them more comfortable",dutchielover@gmail.com,

I was skeptical of how these adhered to the shoe, and I feel like the ads are intentionally vague about this.  I still like the idea, and didn’t take off another star because I haven’t worn them enough to know whether the silver threads help with the funk, or how well they wash.

Chelsea,Pennington,6,2018-06-20 22:00:42 UTC,3,"They worked pretty well. I bought them before going on a two week trip to Italy where I would be walking a ton. They did a good job of not smelling, even at the end of the two weeks. The front adhesive that is supposed to stick to the top of the shoe came off just about every time I took my shoes off. While I was wearing them, though, it was fine, so just a little annoying whenever I put them back on. I got a blister on one heel, like you would if you didn't wear socks. Overall, I think for everyday use, they're fine, but probably not so much for the heavy walking that I did on my trip. There was also trouble with receiving my order--my internet browser autofilled the wrong address, which I didn't realize until I received the confirmation email. I immediately tried to fix it, and was disappointed there was no modify or cancel order button, only an option to email them, which I did. I didn't hear back and then my order was shipped, and I emailed again. I don't think I heard back until my order had already been delivered and obviously by that time it was too late, so I had to pay to have my parents ship them from their house (the incorrect address that had been filled in) to mine. I understand it was my fault for not checking the address, but it was a little frustrating that there wasn't a simpler solution.

This worked ok but they would have stayed better if I could have gotten the bottom piece in as well. I put them in my slip on converse shoes.

However, I found that the material felt very warm and did not feel as breathable as I would have liked, especially in the summer heat. The sticky at the heel did not stick well and needed to be pushed hard to just stay put. Even then, it would not stick, but that could be because of the material of the shoes. While the gekks for the loafers didn't have this issue much, I found that the gekks for the flats had times where it would slip off from the toes area.

I had totally been looking forward to receiving the Gekks as I dislike wearing socks (and even shoes when I can avoid it!).  My initial problem was that it was never pointed out that the item itself really is a little sock--it's just adhered to the parts you permanently place in your shoes.  And it wasn't a comfy little sock--it felt uncomfortable on my feet like I wanted to constantly adjust what parts were hitting my toes.  My second problem was that it was never pointed out that your shoes would feel tighter/smaller because of the double inserts that you were placing in them.  I just didn't expect my comfortable loafers to suddenly feel a little too small.  ,polly50@optonline.net,

I put them in my TOMS (a brand that is featured when you order) and they don't fit super great.  The tongue attaches to the top in a way that makes it impossible for the elastic in TOMS to stretch.  I basically have to peel them away from the top of my foot when I take them off.  I also purchased a pair for my Born ballet flats.  I wear these daily to work.  After 2 weeks of wearing them, the back piece adhesive is completely gone making them totally worthless.  The Gekks smell just as bad as you would expect a 2 week old pair of socks to smell.

It's nice not to have to hunt around for  small socks - they're already in your shoes!  

Installation was a bit tricky for the first shoe - for me, who refuses to read instructions - it really would have made installation much easier.  Fortunately, Gekks are fool-proof, so even though this fool pulled the wrong thing  apart, it was easy to correct, and they fit perfectly anyway.  So first point - please read the instructions:  there are drawings, and the instructions are very clear. Installation in the second shoe was a breeze - following directions.

Geeks are pretty soft on the soles of your feet - I live in a cold climate, and winter feet can be a bit tender.  The Gekks feel fine.  They stay in place nicely, and don't bunch or wrinkle.  Another reason for proper installation - take your time, then you're set. 

As I only recently purchased the ballet and the loafer Gekks, am looking forward to how they hold up over time.  They seem sturdy, and flexibly comfortable.  I wouldn't use them in serious golf or tennis shoes, as you need more cushioning, but for everyday walking, they're excellent.

They have a pretty discreet look in your shoes, as well, when you take your shoes off.

I'll be purchasing more, as they work, and the price quite sensible - and summer is coming!!!  Thank you for making life a little softer and easier!

,Katie,6,2017-06-14 17:23:54 UTC,4,"I like Gekks.  They are a good alternative to the no-show socks that either show anyway, or don't stay on my feet.  Since they attach to the inside of your shoe, where the sock goes is customizable.  They are also pretty good at staying clean, but I do need to wash them every couple of wears, especially if they are inside my leather shoes that don't breathe much, a little more frequently than I expected.  The other thing is that the heel sticker doesn't like to stick much to canvas inners - it would be nice to have a stronger adhesive for canvas or include a few extra heel grippers instead of me having to order them and pay for shipping.  I'd also like to be able to order additional sole grippers instead of only being able to get them with a full sock set.  Overall, though, this is a good solution to the woes of no-show socks and I've recommended them to friends.  ",katie.borthwick@gmail.com,

Chelsea,Overmire,6,2017-09-21 04:02:24 UTC,3,I'm having issues with the loafer pair not being comfortable. I got some red spots on the top of my feet from what I assume is rubbing on the gekks. The flats that I need more out of have tuned out to be a bigger disappointment so far. The heel has slipped and I believe this is due to the heat in the shoe and the pressure of my foot moved the whole set up. It also isn't greatly comfortable. I feel like in the flats I have a lot of weird slack in the middle although I cut to my size. I'm not sold on trying any more gekks unless further improvements are made. ,chelseag007@gmail.com,

Nothing is designed to stick in the toe area. This is strange because it makes the stretchy liner spring back when I take the shoe off and then when I put it on it has to stretch again like the rubber band on a slingshot. It makes it awkward to put these shoes on. I wish the adhesive was in the toe, not just the middle, tongue and heel. ",daphne.bugelli@kaplan.com,

My only frustration is that the stickiness of the tape is not that strong.  The back heels of the socks don't stick too well.

The main reason I bought these was to stop getting blisters from my flats from my shoes rubbing the back of my heel. The heel tab that goes in the back of the shoe did not go up high enough and it was so thin, it was pretty useless at providing comfort. I still had to put bandaids around  the back of my heel to prevent blisters, which I was doing before Gekks, so I spent $18 just to make my toes feel nice. Maybe, consider making a heel tab that is long and can be cut down like shoe inserts can be cut to fit a shoe. Also one that is thicker. ",aleck006@gmail.com,

Dustin,G.,3-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,2016-02-11 04:00:00 UTC,5,"I was rather skeptical about Gekks. Not the concept but how they would actually preform. Despite my concerns I was hoping they would work as advertised and ordered a 3 pack. They arrived the other day and I was immediately impressed with the build and material quality. They seem substantial without being thick or imposing, the gel was uniform and precisely applied and one can see the care taken in designing and executing them. Applying them to my kudu leather, penny loafers was a breeze as was putting on the shoes afterwards. Sliding my foot in gave me the feeling I was wearing socks but the design kept the Gekks fully hidden and they remained so for the day. This is a fantastic product and I wish them much success.

I've never wore socks in the past with Sperry's. I've tried the no-show socks once and did not like them at all. The Gekks liners do keep the skin drier pulling the sweat away from skin. It was recommend that should look into wearing (start wearing) at least a light sock even with boat shoes earlier last year during a physical medical exam.

I do like the sticky aspects of the liner and the fact that it doesn't lift out of the shoe, however, I wish that it were more of an insole with a bit more thickness in the base. the sock area around the toe is hit and miss with me. If you put it on and its completely smooth, it is pretty good. However, most times, I find the fabric bunching under my toes, and if a rock or dirt got into my shoe, its extremely cumbersome to have to take the sock completely out to clear the debris.

Haley,Hunt,Extra Gripper Sets,2017-03-27 13:51:54 UTC,4,"The extra grippers have come in handy as I plan to use my two pairs of Gekks with 4 different pairs of shoes. However, One of my Gekk pairs is slightly different than the other and I noticed it wasn't wearing as well. The back of the nude Gekk wasn't sticking well to my shoes and it ended up rubbing off the back gripper when I tried to adjust it. Similar to a bandaid, when I tried to adjust the Gekk, the gripper was mangled and pulled right off. I noticed the difference between the nude and black Gekks at that point. While I'm glad to have the extra sets on hand, it was concerning that it wasn't functioning as well as the other, black, pair of Gekks.  ",hmhunt2@gmail.com,

They did take a while to ship though. I found it really easy to put in and after a couple tries I was able to get my feet in the socks comfortably. The first couple tries I kept getting the toe end all tangled but it's perfect now. It definitely helps when it's warm and my feet get hot. I have them in my tieks and when my feet would sweat my tieks would feel uncomfortable because of the leather insole. They would stick to the inside of the shoe and now they don't and are super comfy. I'm definitely happy I bought these! ,savchase@hotmail.com,

I installed them both the same, one worked perfectly, but  fine he other had a corner that wouldn’t stay adhered and rubbed a blister on my foot. I requested a replacement, not of the entire set, just the one piece of one gripper, but haven’t heard back. I’m waiting to hear back from customer service. Hopefully they’ll help. If not I’ve wasted $20 on an unusable product. ",shinemysink@yahoo.com,

Ruth,Jeddis,Extra Gripper Sets,2017-11-30 14:59:42 UTC,1,"I will tell you what I think with pleasure.  I e mailed you twice and never had the courtesy of a reply. When I tried to  put in the extra Gekk I seemed to have a problem.  When I took off the backing  and tried to put it in the shoe one side stuck but the other side was slick and so the Gekk would not adhere.  I tried to figure this out but it is beyond me I am sorry to say.  I had asked for help but none was forthcoming.  So I disposed the pair I ruined and the others are in my drawer.  I really do not think you want me to post this.  Ruth Jeddis

Mia,Tierney,Extra Gripper Sets,2017-12-19 09:39:10 UTC,1,"After waiting almost 3 weeks for these. I'm very sorry to say that they are not comfortable or practical. I put the loafer style in my new favourite shoes (with great difficultly - the gekks kept sticking to themselves)  only to find that my shoes do not fit with gekks in. I squeezed my foot into them and couldn't walk more than a few steps. I took the gekks out and re-installed them thinking I had done something wrong. But faced the same issue the second time around. After removing the gekks completely I discovered the stickers had ripped the finish off the inside of my NEW shoes. I'm now off to visit the shoe repair store to have this fixed. I think you should warn future customers that in some shoes, with gekks installed they may cause the shoe not to fit. I guess it's back to the old reliable no-show sock for me.  ",mia7@me.com,
Taylor,Westbrook,Extra Gripper Sets,2017-12-21 14:55:34 UTC,4,"They're great! I did have some trouble installing the grippers because the perforations in the backing weren't complete, so the paper ripped, making installation harder.

Jess,Yocum,Extra Gripper Sets,2017-12-28 20:26:26 UTC,3,"So the Gekks overall are pretty great. I bought the extra gripper sets hoping that I wouldn’t need them for at least a few months, but found that I needed one after a SINGLE DAY of wearing my shoes. The gripper that came with my gekk had slid and bunched up in a brand new shoe. I was glad I had one on hand so that I didn’t have to worry about not being able to wear the shoe.

Donna,M,Extra Gripper Sets,2018-01-10 16:44:33 UTC,1,I am extremely disappointed with the experience I received with this company.

Eugene,Loose,Extra Gripper Sets,2018-01-16 21:13:09 UTC,3,"I like the concept and think I like the product. I don't find the easy to apply, have not tried changing ""sock"" from one pair of shoes to another pair, and I'm not certain I agree that it doesn't affect the size. Like the feel and convenience of removing shoes and putting them back on. If practice makes product easier to apply to shoes, I think I'll promote product. Still trying to decide.

MaryAnn,McClendon,Extra Gripper Sets,2018-02-26 14:50:20 UTC,4,"These socks are such an upgrade to the little footie socks I always wore before. I never worry about them slipping off, and it’s so nice to not have to dig through my sock drawer for tiny socks all the time. I tried to save money and just bought one pair of socks and extra sets of grippers with the intention of just changing out the socks depending on which shoe I was wearing that day. Although this could work fine, I would recommend just buying multiple pairs of socks; the Velcro-like material that keeps the socks attached to the grippers is pretty strong, and it’s a bit of an ordeal to change out the socks every time I wear a different pair of shoes. Overall, such a great purchase! ",maryann.mcclendon91@gmail.com,
